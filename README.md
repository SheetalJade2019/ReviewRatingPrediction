# Review Rating Prediction System

### Introduction

Nowadays recommendation systems are playing important role in e-commerce for targeted marketing, personalized recommendation etc. Reviews or ratings can be used to recommend products to indivisual person. 

### Aim
The aim of our system is to extract contextual information from the user reviews using NLP technique as it is used to produce review-based rating 

### Working
* In our system, we have used tripadvisor dataset with one feature named 'Review' having textual information. and second is target variable Rating. It ranges from 1 to 5.
* To extract information from text, we have used some python libraries and NLP techniques. They are 

          *       Convert sentences into tokens i.e. words
          *       Convert all words to lower case
          *       Remove stopwords of english language
          *       ML algorithm : Multinominal Naive Bayes Algorithm
          *       Tkinter library to create GUI

### Limitation 
 *  It can not understand language having sarcasm or emojis
 *  It cannot detect and ignore fake reviews given by fake people.
 
### Software used

To experiment it, I have used Intel(R) Core (TM) i3-2350 CPU @ 2.30GHz 2.30GHz processor and 4GB RAM 64-bit operating system.
